\title{
Fisher's combined probability method
}
\description{
Fisher's method combines multiple p-values which are calculated in each study.
}
\usage{
Fisher.test(pvals, na.mode = "notignore")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pvals}{
A matrix coming from \code{\link{meta.oneside.noiseq}} function or \code{\link{other.oneside.pvalues}}, which is used for any one-sided p-values or probability.
}
  \item{na.mode}{
A string indicating how to treat NA in pvals. "notignore" means that genes having at least one NA is regarded as NA. "ignore" means NA is ignored and remaining data is used. By default, na.mode = "notignore".
}
