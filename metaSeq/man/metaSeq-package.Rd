\title{
Meta-analysis of RNA-Seq count data in multiple studies
}
\description{
Meta-analysis for multiple studies's RNA-Seq count data. In this package, probability of gene differential is calculated by NOISeq, which is customized for one-sided test. One-sided probabilities are integrated by Fisher's method (without weighting) or Stouffer's method (with weighting by sample-size). Also p-values or probabilities calculated by other methods can be used.
